This project tends to show a static website made with the Jekyll website generator. 
The _site folder shows the index.html where all the changes were made.
I have a main.css file to create all the changes.
In the index.html file, I had to link the main.css file to it for the changes to actaully work.
Everything above this were before the new changes.

Now, I have a jekyll static theme called chirpy.
Everything inside of the folder are the files that it comes with.
